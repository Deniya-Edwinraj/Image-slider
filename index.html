                    <div class="des">Ironically, two of the three waterfalls that make up Canada’s best-known natural wonder are on the US side of the border. But long before international boundaries, this seismic water feature was crafted out of melting glaciers and a giant fault in the riverbed some 10,000 years ago. Today this trio forms a massive U-shape that pours 3160 tons of water into the Niagara Gorge every second — best seen from the Canadian side.</div>

                    <div class="des">Deep in the wilds, dozens of sinkholes pit the dense forest, appearing like vibrant cerulean pools amid a blanket of green. The most photogenic of these is the bewildering Bear Rock Sinkhole, formed by the collapse of a vast cave under the earth’s surface, between the towns of Tulita and Norman Wells.</div>

                    <div class="des">Just beyond Banff’s bustling town centre is this steamy cavern flanking Sulphur Mountain, celebrated as the birthplace of Canada’s national parks. In 1883, railway workers stumbled across the cave and its thermal waters, which resulted in Canada’s first national park, cementing it as a culturally and historically significant natural wonder for all.

                    <div class="des">In the far northern reaches of Nunavut, cosying up to Greenland in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago, it seems unfathomable that 55 million years ago, Ellesmere Island was a wetland forest. While the palm trees and warm weather have long gone, ancient tree stumps remain in an incredible fossil forest, which has helped scientists understand the Arctic before the Ice Age.</div>

Situated on the upper reaches of the Bay of Fundy, famous for its extreme tidal range, you can walk around these unique formations at low tide.</div>

Characterised by pristine stretches of temperate rainforests, alpine mountains and long sandy beaches, there are 40 unique species and subspecies of plants and animals here. It’s also home to Haida communities who continue to protect the region’s rich First Nations culture.</div>
